A really simple Ruby wrapper for Semantic Hacker API (http://semantichacker.com)

Code originally taken from http://hamishrickerby.com/2009/02/26/dealing-with-semantichacker-in-ruby/ and modified to add support for URI's, nicer abstraction, etc.

See test.rb for example usage.

Feel free to fork the repository :)
